MODEL	EXPERIMENT	RESULT	DECISION + EXPLANATION	PARAMETERS








Conv3D	1	Training Accuracy        : 77.83
Validation Accuracy    : 31	Training Accuracy is more than validation Accuracy, hence Over fitting.
	25,54,549

	2	Training Accuracy        : 86.43
Validation Accuracy    : 57.00
	Better than Previous model, but still Over fitting.
	30,737,381

	3	Training Accuracy        : 80.69
Validation Accuracy    : 26
	Overfitting has Increased drastically,  Let's trying adding more layers.

Conv2D+LSTM	Let's try Some models Using Conv2D+LSTM Network

	7	Training Accuracy        : 88.99 Validation Accuracy    : 30	Training Accuracy is more than validation Accuracy, hence Over fitting.
	502,181

	8	Training Accuracy        : 92.31 Validation Accuracy    : 43	Better than Previous model, but still Over fitting.	502,181

	9	Training Accuracy        : 66.82
Validation Accuracy    : 16	When we try to reduce the Params, the accuracy is decreasing by a huge margin.	297,957

	10	Training Accuracy        : 93.21
Validation Accuracy    : 78	As per observation, increasing the params have increased the model performance but slightly Overfitting.	12,82,373

	11	Training Accuracy        : 100 Validation Accuracy    : 89	Not much improvement.	994,117

CNN LSTM with GRU
	12	Training Accuracy        : 99.85
Validation Accuracy    : 91	Though the model is very good, the params are very high, hence avoiding this model keeping the computational cost into consideration.	       36,69,317
